# 🔧 **TIMETABLE GENERATION FIX COMPLETE!**

## ✅ **Issue Fixed: "Branch not found" when clicking Generate Timetable**

### **🎯 What was the problem:**
- The frontend was sending `branch: branchId` but backend expected `branchId: branchId`
- Mismatch in API payload structure caused the backend to not find the branch
- Users needed to seed data first to have branches available

### **✅ What I fixed:**

#### **1. Fixed API Payload Structure** 
Updated `TimetableGenerator.js` to send correct payload:
```javascript
// OLD (incorrect):
const response = await api.post('/timetables/generate', formData);

// NEW (correct):
const payload = {
  branchId: formData.branch,    // Fixed: renamed 'branch' to 'branchId'
  semester: formData.semester,
  subjects: formData.subjects
};
const response = await api.post('/timetables/generate', payload);
```

#### **2. Both servers restarted and running:**
- ✅ **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:5000 
- ✅ **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3000

## 📊 **Technical Details of the Fix:**

### **Backend API Endpoint:** `/api/timetables/generate`
**Expected Payload:**
```javascript
{

  semester: 1,                   // Integer 1-8
  subjects: ["64xyz789abc123"]    // Array of subject ObjectIds
}
```
