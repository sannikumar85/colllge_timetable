2. **🎊 See 50+ professional teacher profiles** with:
   - Complete qualifications (Ph.D, M.Tech, B.Tech)
   - Professional designations (Professor, Associate Prof, etc.)

## 🚨 **If Dashboard Still Shows Zero Teachers:**

### **Quick Troubleshooting:**

#### **Option 1: Clear Browser Data**
```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Del (Chrome) or Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Firefox)
2. Clear cookies, local storage, and cached data
3. Refresh the page (F5)
4. Login again and try seeding data
```

#### **Option 2: Check Authentication**
1. **Ensure you're logged in** - Check if you see "Dashboard" in navigation
2. **If not logged in:** Register/Login first
3. **Try seeding again** after successful login

#### **Option 3: Manual Database Reset**
```powershell
# In MongoDB (if you have access)
use timetable
db.teachers.deleteMany({})
db.branches.deleteMany({})
db.subjects.deleteMany({})
# Then use seed data feature again
```

#### **Option 4: Server Restart (if needed)**
```powershell
# Kill all Node processes
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -eq "node"} | Stop-Process -Force

# Restart backend
cd e:\timetable\backend
node server.js

# Restart frontend (in new terminal)
cd e:\timetable\frontend  
npm start
```
